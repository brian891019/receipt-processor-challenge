# Receipt Processor Challenge

## Introduction

The Receipt Processor Challenge is a RESTful API application that takes in a JSON receipt and returns a JSON object with an ID generated by your code.
The ID returned is the ID that can get the number of points the receipt was awarded.


## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

        git clone https://github.com/brian891019/receipt-processor-challenge.git
    

2. **Change to the project directory:**

        cd receipt-processor-challenge
    

3. **Install Dependencies**

        go mod tidy
    
4. **Running the Application**  

        go run main.go
5 **The output should indicate the server is running:**

        Starting server on :8080

## API Endpoints

- **Upload a Receipt: (Send the POST Request using curl)**

          curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/receipts/process -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "RECEIPT"
  for example
  
          curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/receipts/process -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ \"retailer\": \"M&M Corner Market\", \"purchaseDate\": \"2022-03-20\", \"purchaseTime\": \"14:33\", \"items\": [ { \"shortDescription\": \"Gatorade\", \"price\": \"2.25\" }, { \"shortDescription\": \"Gatorade\", \"price\": \"2.25\" }, { \"shortDescription\": \"Gatorade\", \"price\": \"2.25\" }, { \"shortDescription\": \"Gatorade\", \"price\": \"2.25\" } ], \"total\": \"9.00\" }"

You should receive a response with an ID like:

        {"id": "generated-id"}

          

- **Processed Receipt: (Use the Returned ID to Get Points)**

       curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/receipts/{your-generated-id}/points
Replace {generated-id} with the actual ID returned from the POST request. This should return the points associated with the receipt:

        {"points": <calculated-points>}
