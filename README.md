# Receipt Processor Challenge

## Introduction

The Receipt Processor Challenge is a API application that takes in a JSON receipt and returns a JSON object with an ID generated by code.
The ID returned is the ID that can get the number of points the receipt was awarded.


## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

        git clone https://github.com/brian891019/receipt-processor-challenge.git
    

2. **Change to the project directory:**

        cd receipt-processor-challenge
    

3. **Install Dependencies**

        go mod tidy
    
4. **Running the Application**
   
        go run main.go
   
6. **The output should indicate the server is running:**

        Starting server on :8080

## API Endpoints

- **Upload a Receipt: (Send the POST Request using curl)**
  
        curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/receipts/process -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @receipt.json

    (Note: change the receipt.json file if you want to process other receipt)


    You should receive a response with an ID like:

        {"id": "generated-id"}

          

- **Use the Returned ID to Get Points**

       curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/receipts/{your-generated-id}/points
  
   Replace {generated-id} with the actual ID returned from the POST request. This should return the points associated with the receipt:

       {"points": <calculated-points>}


# Rules

* One point for every alphanumeric character in the retailer name.
* 50 points if the total is a round dollar amount with no cents.
* 25 points if the total is a multiple of `0.25`.
* 5 points for every two items on the receipt.
* If the trimmed length of the item description is a multiple of 3, multiply the price by `0.2` and round up to the nearest integer. The result is the number of points earned.
* 6 points if the day in the purchase date is odd.
* 10 points if the time of purchase is after 2:00pm and before 4:00pm.
